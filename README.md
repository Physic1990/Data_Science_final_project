## Pandas

**What is it?**: Pandas is a powerful Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.

**How did we use it?**: We used Pandas to load, preprocess, and manipulate the time series data. Specifically, we used it to read the dataset from a CSV file, perform data cleaning and transformation tasks, and organize the data in a format suitable for analysis.

## Statsmodels

**What is it?**: Statsmodels is a Python library for estimating and interpreting statistical models.

**How did we use it?**: We used Statsmodels to train and evaluate time series forecasting models, specifically ARIMA and SARIMA. Statsmodels provides implementations of these models, along with tools for parameter estimation, model fitting, and forecasting.

## Plotly

**What is it?**: Plotly is a Python library for creating interactive and publication-quality plots and visualizations.

**How did we use it?**: We used Plotly to visualize the forecasted values generated by the time series models. Plotly allows for the creation of interactive plots that can be customized and shared, providing insights into the forecasted trends and patterns.

## ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

**What is it?**: ARIMA is a popular time series forecasting model that combines autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components.

**How did we use it?**: We used the ARIMA model from Statsmodels to train and forecast future values of the time series data. ARIMA is effective for capturing linear trends and patterns in the data.

---

## SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

**What is it?**: SARIMA is an extension of ARIMA that includes seasonal components to capture periodic patterns in time series data.

**How did we use it?**: Similar to ARIMA, we used the SARIMA model from Statsmodels to train and forecast future values of the time series data. SARIMA is useful when the data exhibits seasonal fluctuations or repeating patterns.

## GPR (Gaussian Process Regression)

**What is it?**: GPR is a machine learning technique for regression tasks that models the distribution over functions directly.

**How did we use it?**: We used GPR from the scikit-learn library to train and forecast future values of the time series data. GPR is a flexible and adaptable model capable of capturing complex nonlinear relationships in the data without assuming a specific functional form.
